# Blaze Electronic Medical Record  (bemr)
A slim Javascript-based implementation of a electronic medical record system.
I coded this to document clinical notes in the more the 16 clinics (~1900 study participants) in a cluster randomised trial.
It basically mirrors all the paper-based forms used in the study.
